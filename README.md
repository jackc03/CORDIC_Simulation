Hi! Thank you for using my CORDIC simulator! To use this program you must do 3 things:
  1. clone this repo using the following command:
  ```
    git clone https://github.com/jackc03/CORDIC_Simulation.git
  ```
  2. compile the cpp code using:
  ```
    g++ source/cordic.cpp -o cordic
  ```
  3. ensure you've placed your input files in input/ and run the following command:
  ```
    ./cordic
  ```
